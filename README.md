# Temperate by Bitscript Technologies
Temperate is a healthcare application that aims to make healthcare more accessible to everyone, everywhere by the use of digitized data, online one-to-one consultation and electronic medical records through the use of barcodes. (http://zakattax.me/temperate)

## Digitized Data
You and your doctor will be able to deal away with handwritten paper records. Instead, digitized user IDs will store medical data for you. All the doctor has to do is scan a barcode, and all your medical history and recent medications will come out.

## Online One-to-One Consultation
You would be able to personalize what services you would use. From one-to-one communication to our consultation systems, you can prioritize which doctor you would want to contact.

## Healthcare, More Accessible
With our one-to-one personalized consultation service, you, as a patient would be able to report what you feel, send pictures and input your symptoms. To ensure that your doctor would be able to see your report immediately after they submit it, our application is equipped with push notifications. Then, your doctor would be able to send back their suggestions, analysis of your sickness and send you a digitized receipt of what medication you need.
